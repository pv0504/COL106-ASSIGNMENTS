# COL106-ASSIGNMENTS
## Assignment-1
In this assignment, we will build a library for Set data structure. This will
involve using the concepts of OOPs.
The goal of this assignment is not to optimise the code for runtime (even nice to optimise it!). Instead, our main focus is on how
to implement Data Structures correctly.
