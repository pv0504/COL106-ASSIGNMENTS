# COL106-ASSIGNMENTS
## Assignment-1
In this assignment, we will build a library for Set data structure. This will
involve using the concepts of OOPs.
The goal of this assignment is not to optimise the code for runtime (even nice to optimise it!). Instead, our main focus is on how
to implement Data Structures correctly.<br/><br/>
## Assignment-2
In this assignment we will implement a reverse Polish notation calculator, also called a post-fix notation
calculator.
In order to implement reverse Polish notation calculator, first we need to implement a stack. There
are three parts of this assignment. In part (a) of the assignment we will implement stacks using fixed size
arrays. In part (b) we will use dynamically sized arrays. In part (c) we will implement them using doubly
linked lists.
