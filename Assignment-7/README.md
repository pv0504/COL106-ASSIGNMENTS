# Search Results Ranking and Querying LLM (Sept, 2023 - Nov, 2023)

## Overview

Developed an advanced algorithm to identify top-k relevant paragraphs from large corpuses, including "The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi" and selected works of Maharishi Ramana.

## Key Features

### Corpus Insertion
- **Vector Storage**: Created a vector (corpus) to store paragraphs.
- **Parameter Passing**: Inserted the entire corpus by passing four parameters: `book_code`, `page`, `para`, and `sentence_no`.
- **Frequency Update**: Updated the frequency of words during the corpus insertion process.

### Top-K Paragraph Ranking
- **Preprocessing**: Converted questions to lowercase.
- **Word Frequency Vector**: Stored the frequency of words in the question in a vector (`vectorres`).
- **Presence Check**: Verified if each word in the preprocessed question was present in the corpus using previously stored word frequencies.
- **Scoring Formula**: Calculated the score of each paragraph using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Score} = \sum f(w) \cdot s(w)
  \]
  where \( f(w) \) is the frequency of the word in the paragraph, and \( s(w) \) is the specific corpus frequency + 1 divided by the general corpus frequency + 1 (from `unigram.csv`).

### Porter Stemmer Integration
- **Grammatical Variations**: Implemented the Porter Stemmer to handle grammatical variations (e.g., treating "bringing" and "brings" as the same word).
- **Corpus Insertion**: Stemmed each word in the sentence before pushing it into the corpus.
- **Scoring Adjustment**: Modified the scoring function to prioritize the simultaneous presence of query words by using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Score\_para} += (\text{internal\_word.query\_freq} \times 1000 + \text{freq\_word})
  \]
  ensuring a higher weight for concurrent query word presence.

Compilation
To compile the code, use the following command:

g++ tester.cpp dict.cpp search.cpp qna_tool.cpp -o test

This will create an executable file named test.

Execution
To run the program, use the following command:

./test

Output
Upon  execution, you will see the output as the five paragraphs we have returned and the chat GPTâ€™s reply.

Please note that the actual output may vary based on the input data and parameters used.
